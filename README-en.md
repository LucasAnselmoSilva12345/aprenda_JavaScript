## Hi developers üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a JS code repository made for those who are starting in the language and would like to learn something specific in the language. And of course it is also a repository for those who already program in JS and want to review some concept of he language.

## Repository structures üìÇ

The repository is divided into 3 branches:

- [Main](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main)

  Branch responsible for storing the folders with the initial concepts of JS, has a structure of 9 folders to be followed in order:

  1 - [JavaScript for beginners](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/javascript_iniciantes)

  2 - [Dom in JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/dom_iniciantes)

  3 - [Objects in JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/objetos)

  4 - [Effects on the dom using JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/efeitos_na_dom)

  5 - [Asynchronous JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/javascript_assincrono)

  6 - [Classes in JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/classes)

  7 - [More JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/javascript_plus)

  8 - [Regex in JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/regular-expression)

  9 - [Frontend automation using JavaScript](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/main/automacao-frontend)

  All folders have code examples and practical exercises.

- [projectAnimaisFantasticos](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/projectAnimaisFantasticos)

  This branch is responsible for storing a project, which puts into practice everything that was taught in the concepts, all the knowledge acquired is put into practice in this project, nicknamed [Animais Fantasticos](https://projectanimaisfantasticos.aprenda-javascript.pages.dev/)

  The technologies used in the application were:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JS

- [slide](https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript/tree/slide)

  This branch contains an application that consists of developing an image transition slide, also using many concepts learned in the available material, and using the same technologies used in the project [Animais Fantasticos](https://projectanimaisfantasticos.aprenda-javascript.pages.dev/)

## How to use this study material

A recommendation to study and delve into this material is to follow the following order of branches: 

`main - projectAnimaisFantasticos - slide`. 

Following this order, you will acquire knowledge from theory to practice, in addition to going through several JavaScript use cases.

So, the first step for you who want to study this material, just make a clone of this repository:

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/LucasAnselmoSilva12345/aprenda_JavaScript.git
```

Run the command:

```sh
  $ git checkout main
```
The `main` branch is already selected by default when performing a clone of the repository, so running this command is optional. 

---

To go to the `projectAnimaisFantasticos`, run the following command:

```sh
  $ git checkout projectAnimaisFantasticos
```

Or if you want to go to the `slide`, run the command:

```sh
  $ git checkout slide
```

Once that's done, all you need to do now is have dedication and focus to become a master in JS & Of course, always remember to put into practice everything you learn in this material and also in everything you should study.
